# nltk

Brings Python [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) to R.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("news-r/nltk")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(nltk)

sentence <- "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii."

(tokens <- nltk_word_tokenize(sentence))

nltk_pos_tag(tokens)
```

## Reources

The above relies on external resources.

```r
nltk_download("punkt")
nltk_download("averaged_perceptron_tagger")
```
